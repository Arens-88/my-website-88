This is a placeholder for amazon-report-tool-setup.exe

In a real production environment, this would be the actual setup executable for the Amazon Multi-Platform Data Integration Report Tool.

The setup file should include:
1. The Python runtime environment
2. All required dependencies (Flask, pandas, etc.)
3. The backend application code
4. The frontend assets
5. An installation wizard that guides users through the setup process

When installed, the application should:
1. Create a desktop shortcut
2. Install all necessary components
3. Set up automatic updates
4. Configure the application to sync with web settings
5. Provide a user-friendly interface for login and configuration

For testing purposes, you can run the application from the source code directory using:
python start.py
